# Week 12 ‚Äì Cryptography Wrap-Up & Reflections

## üîê Topic Summary:
This week marked the end of my journey through the world of cryptography. I reviewed the key concepts, technologies, attacks, and defenses covered throughout the unit.

Cryptography is more than just math ‚Äî it‚Äôs the foundation of digital trust. From securing personal messages to protecting national secrets, cryptographic systems make secure communication and data protection possible.

Key areas reviewed:
- Classical Ciphers (Caesar, Vigen√®re)
- Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption
- Hash Functions & Digital Signatures
- Key Exchange Protocols
- Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
- Cryptographic Attacks & Defenses
- Emerging Technologies (PQC, ZKPs, Homomorphic Encryption)

## üîÅ Summary of My Learning Journey

| Week | Focus Area                          | Key Insight Gained                                   |
|------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Caesar Cipher                       | Basic shifting is insecure, but good for learning    |
| 2    | Vigen√®re Cipher                     | Polyalphabetic ciphers are harder to break           |
| 3    | One-Time Pad, XOR                   | Perfect secrecy is possible, but not practical       |
| 4    | AES & Block Cipher Modes            | Mode of operation matters as much as the algorithm   |
| 5    | Hash Functions                      | Irreversible, unique fingerprints of data            |
| 6    | Digital Signatures                  | Proof of authenticity and integrity                  |
| 7    | Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange         | Shared secret without transmitting it directly       |
| 8    | Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)     | Trust on the internet is built on certificates       |
| 9    | Real-World Applications             | Encryption is everywhere ‚Äî web, files, blockchain    |
| 10   | Attacks & Defenses                  | Security can fail even if cryptography is perfect    |
| 11   | Emerging Cryptographic Technologies | Quantum-resistant systems are the future             |

## üí¨ Final Reflection

This unit changed how I think about security. Before, I thought encryption was just scrambling data. Now I understand that it involves:

- Careful **key management**
- Choosing the **right algorithms and modes**
- Preventing **side-channel** and **implementation** attacks
- Building **trust** through PKI and digital signatures

I especially enjoyed the Python demonstrations ‚Äî they helped make complex ideas more understandable. I also realized that **secure systems are about people as much as they are about math**. Even perfect encryption can fail if used incorrectly or if passwords are weak.

This journal helped me develop consistent documentation habits and deeper technical understanding. I now feel confident about concepts like **symmetric/asymmetric encryption, hashing, signatures, and real-world applications** of cryptography.
